# Save The World Inventory Logger
This programs allows you to log your schematics, heros, and survivors so you can see if you have them so you don't by them twice.


The way to add stuff:
1. Write the item you want to add to the empty bar right above "Add Item".
2. Press the "Add Item" button and it will be added to the list.

To search for an item:
1. Write the item you want to find above "Search" button.
2. Press the button.
If you have the item then at the bottom a text will appear saying "The item is in the list" with a yellow background else it will say "The item doesn't exist in the list" with a red background.
Then to clear your seach you just need to press the "Clear Search" button.

I think it would be useful for Epic Games to add a search system in Fortnite Save The World but until then you can just log your stuff in this app. Also i don't get any of information anything you do with the app. It purely operates in your computer only.

(All the items on the list are saved on a text file in "/dist/stuff.txt")

==================================================================

Updates will be uploaded when the program is ready and appear to run correctly and have no bugs. If it appears to have an issue then I would be happy to know it and take advice about fixing it. Please keep in mind that i am not a professional coder (Also i used chat gpt to test it out) i just did this for fun and thought it was useful for the game.
